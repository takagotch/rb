*This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which
*will include all the files listed below.
*
*Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/styleshets,
*vendor/assets/styleshets, or vendor/assets/styleshets of plugins, if any,
*
*You're free to add application-wide styles file and they'll appear
*at the bottom of th compiled file so the styles you add here take
*precedence over styles defined in any styles defined in the other CSS/SCSS
*file in this directory. It is generally better to create a new file per
*style scope.
